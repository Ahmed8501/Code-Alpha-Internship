# **Credit Scoring Model**

This project demonstrates the development of a **Credit Scoring Model** using Python and machine learning techniques. It includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and the application of various classification algorithms to predict creditworthiness.

## **Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Data cleaning  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Encoding categorical variables  
  - Feature scaling  

- **Model Development:**
  - Implemented multiple algorithms:  
    - Decision Trees  
    - Random Forests  
    - Logistic Regression  
    - K-Nearest Neighbors  
    - Naive Bayes  
    - XGBoost  

- **Evaluation:**
  - Comprehensive performance metrics:  
    - Accuracy  
    - Precision  
    - Recall  
    - ROC curves
